# minimum Operations
This is a Python function called minOperations that takes an integer n as input and calculates the minimum number of operations needed to obtain n "H" characters in a text file using only the operations "Copy All" and "Paste". Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

The function first checks if n is equal to 1. If n is 1, then the text file already contains the desired "H" character, so no operations are needed. In this case, the function simply returns 0.

If n is not 1, then the function calculates the prime factorization of n. This is done by iterating over all integers i from 2 to the square root of n, and checking if i divides n evenly. If i is a factor of n, then the function divides n by i and records the factor i and its exponent in a dictionary called factors. This process continues until n is no longer divisible by i. If n is greater than 1 at this point, then it is also a factor of n and its exponent is recorded in factors.

For example, if n is 12, then the prime factorization of n is 2^2 * 3^1, so the factors dictionary would be {2: 2, 3: 1}.

Once the prime factorization of n has been calculated, the function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to obtain n "H" characters in the text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste". This is done by summing the exponents of each factor in the factors dictionary.

For example, if the factors dictionary is {2: 2, 3: 1} (which corresponds to n = 12), then the minimum number of operations needed to obtain 12 "H" characters is 2 + 1 = 3, since we need to "Copy All" and "Paste" twice for the factor 2 and once for the factor 3.

Finally, the function returns the minimum number of operations needed to obtain n "H" characters in the text file.
