# UTF8 - encoding

UTF8 is a variable width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes. The encoding is defined by the Unicode Standard, and was originally designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. It is the default encoding for the World Wide Web and is also used for email.
